### Hello, I'm Steve Morgan and I'm a DevOps Engineer

### About me

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer for Machinify helping deliver value to customers through technology. I've been in technology for over 15 years. In 2016 I started supporting Jet.com which was born in the cloud and leveraging Microsoft's Azure. Later that year Walmart purchased the company and in 2019 I found myself on the Microsoft Exchange team for Global Walmart. A year after my move, I felt like I was missing what I enjoyed in technology; building, engineering, automating. Bureaucracy and governance got in the way of every project I worked on and it didn't take long for me to miss working in the cloud. After some research I found DevOps and fell in love with everything I read about it. After reading The Phoenix Project, I knew it was the direction I needed to head. I enrolled in a Computer Science undergrad program and began working learning everything else I could get my hands on to carve out the path I needed to move into the DevOps space.

### My current learning focus

As a DevOps Engineer I work with bash, Ansible, AWS cloud resources like EC2, and Kubernetes. We monitor our environments with tools like Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana. Outside of work my focus for the 2022 year is to get better at writing software. I'm spending my time with Data Structures and Algorithms while practicing in Python. I'm also learning Golang. You'll see various repos supporting both of those as the year progresses.

### Feel free to reach out!

I'm always interested in learning and progressively getting better every day. I'm lucky to have a supportive family and professional team that affords me this opportunity. I think the best way to learn is through an exchange of knowledge.
