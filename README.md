### About me

I'm currently a DevOps Engineer for Machinify helping deliver value to customers through technology. I've been in technology for over 15 years. In 2016 I started supporting Jet.com which was born in the cloud and leveraging Microsoft's Azure. Later that year Walmart purchased the company and in 2019 I found myself on the Microsoft Exchange team for Global Walmart. A year after my move, I felt like I was missing what I enjoyed in technology; building, engineering, automating. Bureaucracy and governance got in the way of every project I worked on and it didn't take long for me to miss working in the cloud. After some research I found DevOps and fell in love with everything I read about it. After reading The Phoenix Project, I knew it was the direction I needed to head. I enrolled in a Computer Science undergrad program and began working learning everything else I could get my hands on to carve out the path I needed to move into the DevOps space.
